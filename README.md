## Project Description

An API for a Social Network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application constitutes the backend area of the social network project by connecting a series of user queries with the server and the database.

Using JavaScript, Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM, this app allows the user to create a username that is linked to a unique email address. The user can see a list of all the users, update, see and delete a user by ID, and add and delete friends that belong to the social network. Furthermore, the user can create thoughts in the form of posts, and update, see and delete them. Finally, the user can add reactions to other users' thoughts, and also delete them.
